Online Retail Data Analysis (2010-2011)
This repository contains the analysis of an online retail transactional dataset from 2010 to 2011, focusing on key business questions related to revenue trends, top-performing international markets, and regional product demand. The insights gained from this analysis are crucial for strategic decision-making in forecasting, marketing, and market expansion.
Project Overview
The analysis addresses critical business inquiries from both the CEO and CMO, utilizing various data visualization techniques and a newly defined 'Revenue' measure. Null values within the dataset were cleaned to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Key Questions Addressed & Insights
1. 2011 Revenue Time Series Analysis & Seasonal Trends
Objective: To analyze the time series of revenue data for the year 2011, focusing on monthly granularity to identify seasonal trends and their underlying causes for future forecasting.

Key Findings:
The year 2011 demonstrated an overall upward trend in revenue.
A notable peak in revenue was observed in November, indicating a significant surge during that month. (Further specific details on the magnitude of the peak and potential reasons, e.g., holiday sales, Black Friday, would enhance this section).
2. Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries (Excluding UK) and Quantity Sold
Objective: To identify the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue, excluding the United Kingdom, and to analyze the corresponding quantities sold to understand international market performance.

Key Findings:
The analysis identified key international markets demonstrating strong revenue generation. The top countries include: Netherlands, Eire, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Spain. (To complete this section, the remaining top countries and their specific revenue and quantity figures are needed).
This visual helps the CMO understand which international markets are most lucrative in terms of both revenue and sales volume.
4. Product Demand by Region (Excluding UK)
Objective: To gain insights into product demand across various countries (excluding the United Kingdom) to identify regions with high demand for potential expansion strategies.

Key Findings:
The analysis focused on identifying countries with significant product demand, crucial for informing the company's expansion strategy. (Please provide the specific countries/regions, excluding the UK, that showed high demand, and the metrics used to determine this demand, such as total quantity sold or number of orders, to make this section more precise.)
While the initial input mentioned the UK, the analysis for expansion opportunities specifically focused on international markets beyond the UK to identify new target areas.
